// Assignment # 2, time of the day ADT implementation
// Vladimir Lazovskiy

/*Design and implement an ADT that represents the time of day. Represent the time as hours and minutes on a 24-hour clock. The hours and minutes are the private data members of the class that implements the ADT. Include at least two initialization operations: one that provides a default value for the time, and another that sets the time to a client-supplied value. These operations are the classâ€™s constructors. Also include operations that set the time, increase the present time by a number of minutes, and display the time in 12-hour and 24-hour notations.*/

    ClockTime time_2(12, 20);
    
    /* Initialize to incorrect input.
     Excpected error message.*/
    ClockTime time_3(-12, 20);
